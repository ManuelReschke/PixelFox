# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PixelFox is an image sharing platform built with Go, using GoFiber as the web framework and Templ for HTML templating. The project is containerized with Docker and uses MySQL for data persistence and Dragonfly for caching.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+ with GoFiber v2 framework
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with oapi-codegen for type-safe API generation
- **Templates**: Templ templating engine (.templ files)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.4 with GORM ORM
- **Cache**: Dragonfly (Redis-compatible)
- **Frontend**: HTMX, Hyperscript, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, SweetAlert2
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Migrations**: golang-migrate/migrate
- **Backup**: S3-compatible storage (Backblaze B2) with automatic background jobs

## Database Changes

Important! If you want to make changes to the database, modify the model, check whether it is included in Automigrate in SetupDatabase(), and then perform a db reset. After that, the database will be available with all changes.

### Key Components

#### Image Processing
The `imageprocessor` package handles image uploads with automatic format conversion and variant generation (small, medium, AVIF, WebP formats).

#### Authentication
User authentication is handled through sessions with login/logout functionality and user registration with email activation.

#### Template System
Uses Templ for type-safe HTML templating. Templates are in `.templ` files and must be compiled to Go code using `templ generate`.

#### API System
The project uses OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for API documentation and oapi-codegen for generating type-safe Go code. API handlers and models are auto-generated from the OpenAPI spec located in `public/docs/v1/openapi.yml`.

#### Database Models
Main entities include User, Image, Album, Tag, News, Comment, ImageBackup, and StoragePool models with GORM relationships.

#### S3 Backup System
The S3 backup system provides automatic cloud backup functionality:
- **Automatic Backups**: Every uploaded image is automatically backed up to S3-compatible storage
- **Background Processing**: Uses a Redis-based job queue system with worker pools
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed backups are automatically retried every 2 minutes
- **Provider Support**: Currently supports Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible API)
- **Status Tracking**: All backup operations are tracked in the `image_backups` table
- **Configuration**: Controlled via environment variables (S3_BACKUP_ENABLED, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)

#### Unified Job Queue System
Centralized Redis-based background job processing system:
- **Unified Architecture**: Replaced dual queue system (ImageProcessor + JobQueue) with single Redis-based solution
- **Worker Pool**: 5 configurable worker processes handling all job types
- **Job Types**: 
  - `image_processing`: Image optimization, thumbnail generation, and variant creation
  - `s3_backup`: Automatic cloud backup of processed images  
  - `s3_delete`: Cloud backup cleanup jobs
- **Sequential Pipeline**: Image processing automatically triggers S3 backup when enabled
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff for all job types
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time processing status cached in Redis with TTL
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly shuts down with the application to prevent job loss
- **Job Cleanup**: Completed jobs are automatically removed from Redis to save memory
- **Migration**: Use `jobqueue.ProcessImageUnified()` instead of deprecated `imageprocessor.ProcessImage()`

#### Album System
The album functionality provides comprehensive photo organization capabilities:
- **Album Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete private albums with title and description
- **Photo Organization**: Add/remove existing images to/from albums via intuitive modal interface
- **Cover Images**: Select any album photo as the cover image
- **Responsive Display**: Custom CSS grid system adapts from 2 columns (mobile) to 7 columns (4K displays)
- **Image Variants**: Utilizes optimized image formats (AVIF, WebP) with fallbacks for performance
- **Navigation**: Accessible via "Meine Alben" in the user navigation bar

#### Storage Pool Management
The storage pool system provides flexible storage management with tiering capabilities:
- **Hot/Cold/Warm/Archive Tiering**: Configure storage pools with performance tiers for optimal resource allocation
- **Hot-Storage-First Upload**: Images automatically uploaded to highest priority hot storage pools
- **Pool Management**: Admin interface for creating, editing, and managing storage pools with capacity limits
- **Multi-Type Support**: Local filesystem, NFS, SMB/CIFS, and S3-compatible storage pools
- **S3 Integration**: Full support for S3-compatible services (AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO, etc.)
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Automatic storage pool selection based on available space and tier priority
- **Admin Interface**: Accessible via `/admin/storage` for storage pool management
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation to other available pools when preferred pools are full
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing image processing and backup systems

## Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Use `make start` to spin up the Docker environment
2. **Database**: Run `make migrate-up` to apply database migrations
3. **API**: Run `make generate-api` when modifying OpenAPI specifications
4. **Frontend**: Use `make watch-css` during development for CSS changes
5. **Templates**: In development, Air automatically handles template compilation and hot reload
6. **Testing**: Use `make test-in-docker` to run tests in the containerized environment

### Hot Reload in Development

The development environment uses Air for hot reloading and automatic template compilation. Air runs inside the container and:
- Watches for changes in Go files and automatically rebuilds the application
- Monitors .templ files and runs `templ generate` when templates are modified
- Provides instant feedback during development without manual restarts

## Configuration

- Environment variables are managed through `.env` files
- Use `make prepare-env-dev` for development environment
- Use `make prepare-env-prod` for production environment
- Docker services include app, database, cache, PHPMyAdmin, and MailHog

### S3 Backup Configuration
```bash
# S3/Backblaze B2 backup settings
S3_BACKUP_ENABLED=true
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-west-001  # Must match your bucket region
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.us-west-001.backblazeb2.com  # For Backblaze B2
```

**Important**: For Backblaze B2 compatibility, use AWS SDK Go v2 versions â‰¤ 1.27.2 to avoid checksum header conflicts.

## Container Access

- **App**: `docker-compose exec app bash`
- **Database**: PHPMyAdmin at `localhost:8081`
- **Cache**: Dragonfly at `localhost:6379`
- **Mail**: MailHog at `localhost:8025`
- **Metrics**: Available at `/metrics` with basic auth

## Important Notes

- The application uses a 100 MiB body limit for file uploads
- Static files are served with compression and caching
- Images are processed into multiple variants for optimization
- All templates must be compiled after modification
- Database migrations are managed through the custom migrate command
- API code is auto-generated from OpenAPI specs - modify the spec, not the generated code
- API documentation is available at `/api/v1/docs` when running

### Backup System Notes
- S3 backups are triggered automatically on every image upload
- Failed backups are retried every 2 minutes automatically
- Job queue starts automatically with the application and handles graceful shutdown
- Backup status can be monitored in the admin queue dashboard
- For Backblaze B2: Use AWS SDK Go v2 â‰¤ 1.27.2, set region to bucket region, enable path-style URLs
- Completed backup jobs are automatically cleaned from Redis to prevent memory bloat

### Storage Pool System Notes
- Default local storage pool is created automatically on first startup
- Hot storage pools are prioritized for new uploads to optimize performance
- Storage pools track capacity limits and prevent overallocation
- **S3 Storage Pools**: Full support for S3-compatible storage as primary storage (not just backup)
- **S3 Configuration**: Access Key ID, Secret Key, Region, Bucket Name, Endpoint URL, and Path Prefix
- **S3 Providers**: Supports AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO, and other S3-compatible services
- URL generation uses centralized constants from `internal/pkg/constants/routes.go`
- Image variants and originals use the `/uploads/` static route for web accessibility
- Admin interface provides real-time storage usage monitoring with S3 pool creation
- Storage pool paths are automatically integrated with existing backup and processing systems
- **HTMX Compatibility**: Storage pool forms work seamlessly with HTMX navigation
- **CSRF Protection**: All storage pool operations are protected with CSRF tokens
