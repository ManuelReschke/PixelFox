# PixelFox Cache (Dragonfly) â€“ .env (example)

# This file is intentionally minimal. The cache container in
# docker/prod/cache.compose.yml does not require environment variables.
# Keep this file if you prefer running `docker compose --env-file .env`.

# Example: If you want to control Dragonfly args via env and an entrypoint
# wrapper you could add variables here (not needed by default).
